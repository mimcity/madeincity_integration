## Notes

- Check Figma comments for reference.

1. Is navbar going to be sticky? Will it be at top side when we scroll down?

2. Is there an arrow icon next to logo at desktop view?

3. Please specify the icon library that I need to use. I suggest Hero Icons, official Tailwind CSS icon library.

4. For Experiences section, should I implement the "play video on rollover" logic?

5. Apple Store and Google Play Store section is only an image. It's better if we code instead of using an static Image. If you agree, need details such as font size, font weight and colors.
